# Inventory Tracker

Inventory Tracker is a simple information system designed to track and manage (motorcycle) repair components. The system helps a user keep track of items that need to be purchased, repaired, or replaced, along with their costs.

## Features

- Add, view, edit, and delete items in the inventory (CRUD operations).

- Categorize items by their status (e.g., pending, purchased, repaired).

- Generate simple reports (e.g., total costs for planned vs. completed purchases).

- Future-ready for user authentication and integration with external services.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js

- **Backend**: Python (Flask or FastAPI)

- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL)

## Setup and Deployment

The system is designed for easy deployment:

- Locally on a developer's machine.

- On a Raspberry Pi (local network or routed for remote access).

- On a university server for remote access.

## Getting Started

1\. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VandlJ/inventory-tracker.git
   cd inventory-tracker
   ```

2\. Install dependencies for the backend and frontend (instructions to be added).

3\. Run the development server.

## Roadmap

### Initial Phase:

- [x] Design the data model for items.

- [x] Set up the basic project structure.

- [ ] Implement backend APIs for CRUD operations.

- [ ] Create a React-based frontend for the user interface.

- [ ] Test locally on Docker.

### Future Enhancements:

- Authentication and user management.

- Integration with APIs (e.g., e-commerce or cloud storage).

- Advanced reporting and analytics.

- Notification system for overdue repairs or purchases.
